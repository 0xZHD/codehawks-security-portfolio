## 🛡️ Audit Philosophy  
I follow a **systematic and adversarial approach** to reviews:  
1. **Scoping** – Understand protocol design & assumptions.  
2. **Reconnaissance** – Explore code base, external docs, dependencies.  
3. **Threat Modeling** – Identify key assets, attack surfaces, and risks.  
4. **Testing** – Write fuzzing, invariant, and unit tests in Foundry.  
5. **Reporting** – Deliver concise and actionable findings.
